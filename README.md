# Etch-A-Sketch

Project from The Odin Project [Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)

## **What I learned**:

By doing this part of the project, I learned

- Manipulate DOM tree and dynamically create html elements(creating the square divs in the sketchpad)
- Toggling classes in a node
- Using eventlisteners by adding eventlisteners to divs to change color and buttons to select mode, color, etc.

## **Preview**:

## **Features to be added in future**:
- Eraser mode
- Drawing starts only after a 'single-click'
- Shader mode - each pass just add or remove 10% of alpha value
- Option to turn borders on or off
- Button to fill color
